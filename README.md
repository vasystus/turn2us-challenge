# ↩️The idea of the challenge:

 #### The requirement is to build a page that allows user to verify their age and directs them to a new page informing them of their eligibility on the basis of their answer.
---
# 📋 User stories:

- As a new visitor to the site I would like to check if I'm eligible to apply for some benefits. 
- If I'm 18 years old or over, I want to be redirected to the page with benefits avaivible to me.
- If I'm under 18, I want to be told I'm not eligible to apply yet and pointed to other resources.

---

# 🐾Next steps: 

- To manage the redirection to another pages;
- Build a testing library for the project;
